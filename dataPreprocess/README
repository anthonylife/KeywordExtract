Implementation notes:
=====================
1.For postagger, we utilize Stanford log-linear postagger.
As it is implemented using Java, we place related Java
code project Postagger in ~/workspace directory.

2.We use java to implement the client for computing semantic
similarity between word pairs with Wikipedia knowledge base.
